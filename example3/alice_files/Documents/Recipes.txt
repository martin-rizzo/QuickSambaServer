1. Spaghetti Carbonara:
Ingredients:
- 200g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta or bacon, diced
- 2 large eggs
- 50g grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. Cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well.
2. In a skillet, cook pancetta or bacon until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.
4. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta or bacon. Pour the egg mixture over the spaghetti and quickly toss to coat. The heat from the spaghetti will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper.

4. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and drizzle with olive oil. Season the outside of the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
5. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) and the juices run clear when pierced with a fork.
6. Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with roasted vegetables or your favorite side dishes.
