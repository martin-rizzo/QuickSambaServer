<p><i>The story
goes something like this:</i>

</p><blockquote>

<p><i>Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel, was visiting his
friend Andrew Tridgell, the creator of the Samba suite.  They were walking
through the Zoo in Canberra when, without warning, a huge flock of vampire
attack penguins dove out of the sky and tried to carry Linus away. 
Fortunately, Andrew had an umbrella.  Still, one of the birds was able to
nip Linus' hand with its fanged beak. Rumor has it that on moonlit nights
Linus still runs out into the darkness and jumps, stark naked, into icy
water.  Of course, he's Finnish and may always have done this.  In any
case, this is why the Penguin is the Linux Mascot.</i>

</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Andrew says that the story has changed a bit since the actual
event.</i>

</p><h2>What Samba is All About</h2>

The commercialization of the Internet over the past few years has
created something of a modern melting pot.  It has brought
business-folk and technologists closer together than was previously
thought possible. As a side effect, Windows and Unix
systems have been invading each others' turf, and people expect that
they will not only play together nicely, but that they will
<b>share</b>.

<p>A lot of emphasis has been placed on peaceful coexistence between Unix
and Windows.  The <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">Usenix Association</a>
has even created an annual conference (<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa-nt99/">LISA/NT--July 14-17,
1999</a>) around this theme.  Unfortunately, the two systems come from
very different cultures and they have difficulty getting along without
mediation.  ...and that, of course, is Samba's job.  <a href="http://samba.org/">Samba</a> runs on Unix platforms, but speaks to
Windows clients like a native.  It allows a Unix system to move into a
Windows "Network Neighborhood" without causing a stir.  Windows
users can happily access file and print services without knowing or caring
that those services are being offered by a Unix host.

</p><p>All of this is managed through a protocol suite which is currently
known as the "Common Internet File System", or CIFS. This name was
introduced by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, and
provides some insight into their hopes for the future.  At the heart of
CIFS is the latest incarnation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol,
which has a long and tedious history.  Samba is an open source CIFS
implementation, and is available for free from the <a href="http://samba.org/"><code>http://samba.org/</code></a> mirror sites.

</p><p>Samba and Windows are not the only ones to provide CIFS networking.
OS/2 supports SMB file and print sharing, and there are commercial CIFS
products for Macintosh and other platforms (including several others for
Unix).  Samba has been ported to a variety of non-Unix operating systems,
including VMS, AmigaOS, &amp; NetWare.  CIFS is also supported on dedicated
file server platforms from a variety of vendors.  In other words, this
stuff is all over the place. 


</p><h2>History - the (hopefully) Untedious Version</h2>

It started a long time ago, in the early days of the PC, when IBM and
Sytec co-developed a simple networking system designed for building small
LANs.  The system included something called NetBIOS, or <i><b>Net</b>work
<b>B</b>asic <b>I</b>nput <b>O</b>utput <b>S</b>ystem</i>. NetBIOS was a
chunk of software that was loaded into memory to provide an interface
between programs and the network hardware.  It included an addressing
scheme that used 16-byte names to identify workstations and
network-enabled applications.  Next, Microsoft added features to DOS that
allowed disk I/O to be <i>redirected</i> to the NetBIOS interface, which
made disk space sharable over the LAN.  The file-sharing protocol that
they used eventually became known as SMB, and now CIFS.

<p>Lots of other software was also written to use the NetBIOS API
(<i><b>A</b>pplication <b>P</b>rogrammer's <b>I</b>nterface</i>), which
meant that it would never, ever, ever go away.  Instead, the workings
beneath the API were cleverly gutted and replaced.  NetBEUI
(<i><b>Net</b>BIOS <b>E</b>nhanced <b>U</b>ser <b>I</b>nterface</i>),
introduced by IBM, provided a mechanism for passing NetBIOS packets over
Token Ring and Ethernet.  Others developed NetBIOS LAN emulation over
higher-level protocols including DECnet, IPX/SPX and, of course, TCP/IP.

</p><p>NetBIOS and TCP/IP made an interesting team.  The latter could be
routed between interconnected networks (internetworks), but NetBIOS was
designed for isolated LANs. The trick was to map the 16-byte NetBIOS names
to IP addresses so that messages could actually find their way through a
routed IP network.  A mechanism for doing just that was described in the
Internet RFC1001 and RFC1002 documents.  As Windows evolved, Microsoft
added two additional pieces to the SMB package.  These were service
announcement, which is called "browsing", and a central
authentication and authorization service known as Windows NT Domain
Control. 


</p><h2>Meanwhile, on the Other Side of the Planet...</h2>

<p>Andrew Tridgell, who is both tall and Australian, had a bit of a
problem.  He needed to mount disk space from a Unix server on his DOS PC. 
Actually, this wasn't the problem at all because he had an NFS
(<i><b>N</b>etwork <b>F</b>ile <b>S</b>ystem</i>) client for DOS and it
worked just fine.  Unfortunately, he also had an application that required
the NetBIOS interface.  Anyone who has ever tried to run multiple
protocols under DOS knows that it can be...er...quirky. 

</p><p>So Andrew chose the obvious solution.  He wrote a packet sniffer,
reverse engineered the SMB protocol, and implemented it on the Unix box. 
Thus, he made the Unix system appear to be a PC file server, which allowed
him to mount shared filesystems from the Unix server while concurrently
running NetBIOS applications.  Andrew published his code in early 1992. 
There was a quick, but short succession of bug-fix releases, and then he
put the project aside.  Occasionally he would get E'mail about it, but he
otherwise ignored it.  Then one day, almost two years later, he decided to
link his wife's Windows PC with his own Linux system.  Lacking any better
options, he used his own server code. He was actually surprised when it
worked. 

</p><p>Through his E'mail contacts, Andrew discovered that NetBIOS and SMB
were actually (though nominally) documented.  With this new information at
his fingertips he set to work again, but soon ran into another problem. 
He was contacted by a company claiming trademark on the name that he had
chosen for his server software.  Rather than cause a fuss, Andrew did a
quick scan against a spell-checker dictionary, looking for words
containing the letters "smb".  "Samba" was in the list. 
Curiously, that same word is not in the dictionary file that he uses
today.  (Perhaps they know it's been taken.) 

</p><p>The Samba project has grown mightily since then.  Andrew now has a
whole team of programmers, scattered around the world, to help with Samba
development.  When a new release is announced, thousands of copies are
downloaded within days.  Commercial systems vendors, including Silicon
Graphics, bundle Samba with their products.  There are even Samba T-shirts
available.  Perhaps one of the best measures of the success of Samba is
that it was listed in the "Halloween Documents", a pair of
internal Microsoft memos that were leaked to the Open Source community. 
These memos list Open Source products which Microsoft considers to be
competitive threats.  The absolutely best measure of success, though, is
that Andrew can still share the printer with his wife.


</p><h2>What Samba Does</h2>

Samba consists of two key programs, plus a bunch of other stuff that we'll
get to later.  The two key programs are <code>smbd</code> and
<code>nmbd</code>.  Their job is to implement the four basic modern-day
CIFS services, which are: 

<ul>
<li>File &amp; print services
</li><li>Authentication and Authorization
</li><li>Name resolution
</li><li>Service announcement (browsing)
</li></ul>

File and print services are, of course, the cornerstone of the CIFS suite.
These are provided by <code>smbd</code>, the SMB Daemon. <code>Smbd</code>
also handles "share mode" and "user mode" authentication
and authorization.  That is, you can protect shared file and print
services by requiring passwords.  In share mode, the simplest and least
recommended scheme, a password can be assigned to a shared directory or
printer (simply called a "share").  This single password is then
given to everyone who is allowed to use the share. With user mode
authentication, each user has their own username and password and the
System Administrator can grant or deny access on an individual basis. 

<p>The Windows NT Domain system provides a further level of authentication
refinement for CIFS.  The basic idea is that a user should only have to
log in once to have access to all of the authorized services on the
network.  The NT Domain system handles this with an authentication server,
called a Domain Controller.  An NT Domain (which should <i>not</i> be
confused with a <i><b>D</b>omain <b>N</b>ame <b>S</b>ystem</i> (DNS)
Domain) is basically a group of machines which share the same Domain
Controller. 

</p><p>The NT Domain system deserves special mention because, until the
release of Samba version 2, only Microsoft owned code to implement the
NT Domain authentication protocols.  With version 2, Samba introduced
the first non-Microsoft-derived NT Domain authentication code.  The
eventual goal, of course, it to completely mimic a Windows NT Domain
Controller.

</p><p>The other two CIFS pieces, name resolution and browsing, are handled
by <code>nmbd</code>.  These two services basically involve the
management and distribution of lists of NetBIOS names.

</p><p>Name resolution takes two forms: broadcast and point-to-point.  A
machine may use either or both of these methods, depending upon its
configuration.  Broadcast resolution is the closest to the original
NetBIOS mechanism.  Basically, a client looking for a service named
<code>Trillian</code> will call out <code>"Yo!  Trillian!  Where are
you?"</code>, and wait for the machine with that name to answer with
an IP address.  This can generate a bit of broadcast traffic (a lot of
shouting in the streets), but it is restricted to the local LAN so it
doesn't cause too much trouble. 

</p><p>The other type of name resolution involves the use of an NBNS
(<i><b>N</b>et<b>B</b>IOS <b>N</b>ame <b>S</b>ervice</i>) server.
(Microsoft called their NBNS implementation WINS, for <i><b>W</b>indows
<b>I</b>nternet <b>N</b>ame <b>S</b>ervice</i>, and that acronym is more
commonly used today.)  The NBNS works something like the wall of an old
fashioned telephone booth. (Remember those?)  Machines can leave their
name and number (IP address) for others to see.

</p><pre>	Hi, I'm node Voomba.  Call me for a good time!  192.168.100.101</pre>

<p>It works like this:  The clients send their NetBIOS names &amp; IP
addresses to the NBNS server, which keeps the information in a simple
database.  When a client wants to talk to another client, it sends the
other client's name to the NBNS server.  If the name is on the list, the
NBNS hands back an IP address.  You've got the name, look up the number. 

</p><p>Clients on different subnets can all share the same NBNS server so,
unlike broadcast, the point-to-point mechanism is not limited to the local
LAN.  In many ways the NBNS is similar to the DNS, but the NBNS name list
is almost completely dynamic and there are few controls to ensure that
only authorized clients can register names. Conflicts can, and do, occur
fairly easily.

</p><p>Finally, there's browsing.  This is a whole 'nother kettle of worms,
but Samba's <code>nmbd</code> handles it anyway.  This is not the web
browsing we know and love, but a browsable list of services (file and
print shares) offered by the computers on a network.

</p><p>On a LAN, the participating computers hold an election to decide which
of them will become the Local Master Browser (LMB).  The "winner" 
then identifies itself by claiming a special NetBIOS name (in addition to
any other names it may have).  The LMBs job is to keep a list of available
services, and it is this list that appears when you click on the Windows
"Network Neighborhood" icon. 

</p><p>In addition to LMBs, there are <i>Domain</i> Master Browsers
(DMBs).  DMBs coordinate browse lists across NT Domains, even on routed
networks.  Using the NBNS, an LMB will locate its DMB to exchange and
combine browse lists. Thus, the browse list is propagated to all hosts
in the NT Domain.  Unfortunately, the synchronization times are spread
apart a bit.  It can take more than an hour for a change on a remote
subnet to appear in the Network Neighborhood.


</p><h2>Other Stuff</h2>

<p>Samba comes with a variety of utilities.  The most commonly used are: 

</p><dl>
<dt>smbclient
    </dt><dd>A simple SMB client, with an interface similar to that of the
        FTP utility.  It can be used from a Unix system to connect to a
        remote SMB share, transfer files, and send files to remote print
        shares (printers).
</dd><dt>nmblookup
    </dt><dd>A NetBIOS name service client.  <code>Nmblookup</code> can be used
        to find NetBIOS names on a network, lookup their IP addresses, and
        query a remote machine for the list of names the machine believes
        it ownes.
</dd><dt>swat
    </dt><dd>The <i><b>S</b>amba <b>W</b>eb <b>A</b>dministration
        <b>T</b>ool</i>.  <code>Swat</code> allows you to configure Samba
        remotely, using a web browser.
</dd></dl>

There are more, of course, but describing them would require explaining
even more bits and pieces of CIFS, SMB, and Samba.  That's where things
really get tedious, so we'll leave it alone for now. 


<h2>SMB Filesystems for Linux</h2>

One of the cool things that you can do with a Windows box is use an SMB
file share as if it were a hard disk on your own machine.  The
<code>N:</code> drive can look, smell, feel, and act like your own disk
space, but it's really disk space on some other computer somewhere else on
the network. 

<p>Linux systems can do this too, using the <code>smbfs</code> filesystem. 
Built from Samba code, <code>smbfs</code> (which stands for <i><b>SMB</b>
<b>F</b>ile<b>s</b>ystem</i>) allows Linux to map a remote SMB share into
its directory structure.  So, for example, the <code>/mnt/zarquon</code>
directory might actually be an SMB share, yet you can read, write, edit,
delete, and copy the files in that directory just as you would local
files.

</p><p>The <code>smbfs</code> is nifty, but it only works with Linux.  In
fact, it's not even part of the Samba suite.  It is distributed with Samba
as a courtesy and convenience.  A more general solution is the new
<code>smbsh</code> (<i><b>SMB sh</b>ell</i>, which is still under
development at the time of this writing).  This is a cool gadget. It is
run like a Unix shell, but it does some funky fiddling with calls to Unix
libraries.  By intercepting these calls, <code>smbsh</code> can make it
look as though SMB shares are mounted.  All of the read, write, etc. 
operations are available to the <code>smbsh</code> user.  Another feature
of <code>smbsh</code> is that it works on a per-user, per shell basis,
while mounting a filesystem is a system-wide operation.  This allows for
much finer-grained access controls.

</p><h2>Setup and Management</h2>

Samba is configured using the <code>smb.conf</code> file.  This is a
simple text file designed to look a lot like those *.ini files used in
Windows.  The goal, of course, is to give network administrators familiar
with Windows something comfortable to play with.  Over time, though, the
number of things that can be configured in Samba has grown, and the
percentage of Network Admins willing to edit a Windows *.ini file has
shrunk.  For some people, that makes managing the <code>smb.conf</code>
file a bit daunting. 

<p>Still, learning the ins and outs of <code>smb.conf</code> is a
worth-while penance.  Each of the <code>smb.conf</code> variables has a
purpose, and a lot of fine tuning can be accomplished.  The file structure
contents are fully documented, so as to give administrators a running head
start, and <code>smb.conf</code> can be manipulated using
<code>swat</code>, which at least makes it nicer to look at. 

</p><h2>The Present</h2>

Samba 2.0 was released in January 1999.  One of the most significant and
cool features of the 2.0 release was improved speed.  Ziff-Davis
Publishing used their Netbench software to benchmark Samba 2.0 on Linux
against Windows NT4. They ran all of their tests on the same PC hardware,
and their results showed Samba's throughput under load to be at least
twice that of NT.  Samba is shipped with all major Linux distributions,
and Ziff-Davis tested three of those.

<p>Another milestone was reached when Silicon Graphics (SGI) became the
first commercial Unix vendor to support Samba.  In their December 1998
press release, they claimed that their Origin series servers running Samba
2.0 were the most powerful line of file servers for Windows clients
available.  SGI now offers commercial support for Samba as do several
other providers, many of which are listed on the Samba web site (see
<code>http://samba.org/</code>).  Traditional Internet support is, of
course, still available via the <code>comp.protocols.smb</code> newsgroup
and the <code>samba@lists.samba.org</code> mailing list.

</p><p>The Samba Team continues to work on new goodies.  Current interests
include NT ACLs (<i><b>A</b>ccess <b>C</b>ontrol <b>L</b>ists</i>),
support for LDAP (<i>the <b>L</b>ightweight <b>D</b>irectory <b>A</b>ccess
<b>P</b>rotocol</i>), NT Domain Control, and Microsoft's DFS
(<i><b>D</b>istributed <b>F</b>ile <b>S</b>ystem</i>).

</p><h2>The Future</h2>

Windows 2000 looms on the horizon like a lazy animal peeking its head over
the edge of its burrow while trying to decide whether or not to come out.
No one is exactly sure about the kind of animal it will be when it does
appear, but folks are fairly certain that it will have teeth.

<p>Because of their dominance on the desktop, Microsoft gets to decide how
CIFS will grow.  Windows 2000, like previous major operating system
releases, will give us a whole new critter to study.  Based on the beta
copies and the things that Microsoft has said, here are some things to
watch for: 

</p><dl>
<dt>CIFS Without NetBIOS
</dt><dd>Microsoft will attempt to decouple CIFS and NetBIOS.  NetBIOS won't go
    away, mind you, but it won't be <em>required</em> for CIFS networking 
    either.  Instead, the SMB protocol will be carried natively over
    TCP/IP.  Name lookups will occur via the DNS.

</dd><dt>Dynamic DNS
</dt><dd>Microsoft will implement Dynamic DNS, a still-evolving system designed
    by the IETF (<i><b>I</b>nternet <b>E</b>ngineering <b>T</b>ask
    <b>F</b>orce</i>).  Dynamic DNS allows names to be added to 
    a DNS server on-the-fly.

</dd><dt>Kerberos V
</dt><dd>Microsoft has plans to use Kerberos V. The Microsoft K5 tickets are
    supposed to contain a <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/1997-11/embraces.html"><i><b>P</b>rivilege
    <b>A</b>ttribute <b>C</b>ertificate</i> (PAC)</a>, which will
    include user and group ID information from the Active Directory.
    Servers will be looking for this PAC when they grant access to the
    services that they provide.  Thus, Kerberos may be used for both
    authentication and authorization.

</dd><dt>Active Directory
</dt><dd>The Active Directory appears to be at the heart of Windows 2000
    networking.  It is likely that legacy NetBIOS services will
    register their names in the Active Directory.

</dd><dt>Hierarchical NT Domains
</dt><dd>Instead of isolated Domain Controllers, the NT Domain system will
    become hierarchical.  The naming system will change to one that is
    remarkably similar to that of the DNS. 
</dd></dl>

One certainty is that W2K (as it is often called) is, and will be, under
close scrutiny.  Windows has already attracted the attention of some of
the Internet Wonderland's more curious inhabitants, including security
analysts, standards groups, crackers dens, and general all-purpose geeks. 
The business world, which has finally gotten a taste of the freedom of
Open Source Software, may be reluctant to return to the world of
proprietary, single-vendor solutions.  Having the code in your hands is
both reassuring and empowering. 

<p>Whatever the next Windows animal looks like, it will be Samba's job to
help it get along with its peers in the diverse world of the Internet. 
The Samba Team, a microcosm of the Internet community, are among those
watching W2K to see how it develops.  Watching does not go hand-in-hand
with waiting, though, and Samba is an on-going and open effort.  Visit the
Samba web site, join the mailing lists, and see what's going on.
