# QuickSambaServer
-->

**QuickSambaServer** makes setting up a file server easy, with simple configuration for both resources and users.

This tool is ideal for sharing files or disk drives among family members or within small businesses, allowing everyone to access and store data centrally.


## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: For container creation, management, and deployment.
- **Alpine Linux**: As the base operating system to minimize image size and improve security.
- **SAMBA**: The standard windows interoperability suite for Linux and Unix.
