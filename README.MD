# Simple SAMBA Server

## Description
Simple SAMBA Server is a lightweight and straightforward implementation of a SAMBA server, aimed at providing easy file sharing and access across networks. SAMBA is a widely used protocol for file sharing between different operating systems, making it ideal for heterogeneous environments. By leveraging Docker container technology, this server offers a portable solution that simplifies deployment and accommodates the diverse requirements of users.

### Key Features
- Designed for making file sharing across networks simple and efficient.
- Provides a functional SAMBA server configured to allow anonymous and authenticated connections with read and write capability.
- Server configuration is done through custom configuration files, enabling easy customization according to user needs.
- Utilizes Alpine Linux as the base to minimize image size and enhance security.
- Uses a Bash script to automate Docker resource building, execution, and cleanup, simplifying server management and deployment.

## Usage
Simple SAMBA Server is ideal for facilitating file sharing across networks, simplifying the process for users familiar with accessing shared folders. It serves as a convenient solution for transferring files between different operating systems seamlessly. Additionally, it can be used for conducting file sharing tests or providing a temporary file storage service.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For container creation, management, and deployment.
- **Alpine Linux**: As the base operating system to minimize image size and improve security.
- **SAMBA**: Industry-standard protocol for file sharing between different operating systems.

## Objective
The objective of Simple SAMBA Server is to provide a seamless solution for implementing a file server that can be accessed from various operating systems within a network. It aims to offer easy file sharing capabilities, simplifying the process for users. By leveraging Docker containers, it streamlines the configuration and management of the SAMBA server without worrying about the complexities of server setup.
