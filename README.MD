# QuickSambaServer
-->

**QuickSambaServer** makes setting up a file server easy, with simple configuration for both resources and users. It's perfect for domestic environments or private settings with trusted individuals. This tool is ideal for sharing files or disk drives among family members or within small businesses, allowing everyone to access and store data centrally.

## Getting Started

You can either build the QuickSambaServer image from the source code or pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

### Building the Image from Source

To build the image from the source code, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/martin-rizzo/QuickSambaServer.git
  cd QuickSambaServer
  ```

  2. Build the image:
  ```bash
  ./docker-cmd.sh build-last-release
  ```

### Pulling the Image from Docker Hub

To pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:
  ```bash
  docker pull martinrizzo/quick-samba-server
  ```

### Running the Container

#### Using the Command Line

To run the container using your current user:
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
      -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
      -p 139:139                     \
      -p 445:445                     \
      --name quick-samba-server      \
      -v /path/to/your/data:/appdata \
      martinrizzo/quick-samba-server
  ```

To run the container using the 'samba' user and group:
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
      -e USER_ID=$(id -u samba) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g samba) \
      -p 139:139                     \
      -p 445:445                     \
      --name quick-samba-server      \
